# CS609 Programming Team Repository
You will use this repository for all of your group's programming work. 
There are two main directories in this repository:
  * __Programming__ - Here you will work together to explore various programming languages.
  * __Intepreter__ - This folder will house your group's term project, where you will create a new interpreted langauge.

# Assignment Submissions
Each group assignment will tell you the correct folder in which you are to place your work.
You will submit your assignments by adding your code to this repository. You will not have the 
option of handing in late work! I will simply grade whatever is in your respoistory at the appointed due date.

# Team Work Requirements
Every member of your group is required to make regular commits to the
repository. You should commit and push at least at the end of each
work session. Each group member will be graded according to their
contribution statistics in github. This means that frequent pushes are
a must! I will be looking at your contributions in terms of how much
code you have contributed. Simply pushing one minor change will not
suffice. I will reduce the grades of any student who I believe has not
done their fair share. You may even earn a grade of zero if you
contribute nothing. So be careful!
